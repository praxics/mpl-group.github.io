  journal={Nature communications},
  abstract={Bacteria often live in diverse communities where the spatial arrangement of strains and species is considered critical for their ecology. However, a test of this hypothesis requires manipulation at the fine scales at which spatial structure naturally occurs. Here we develop a droplet-based printing method to arrange bacterial genotypes across a sub-millimetre array. We print strains of the gut bacterium Escherichia coli that naturally compete with one another using protein toxins. Our experiments reveal that toxin-producing strains largely eliminate susceptible non-producers when genotypes are well-mixed. However, printing strains side-by-side creates an ecological refuge where susceptible strains can persist in large numbers. Moving to competitions between toxin producers reveals that spatial structure can make the difference between one strain winning and mutual destruction. Finally, we print different potential barriers between competing strains to understand how ecological refuges form, which shows that cells closest to a toxin producer mop up the toxin and protect their clonemates. Our work provides a method to generate customised bacterial communities with defined spatial distributions, and reveals that micron-scale changes in these distributions can drive major shifts in ecology.},

  journal={Advanced Functional Materials},
   abstract={Biology employs modular organization at every scale: molecular building blocks make up living cells, specialized cells organize within tissues, and collections of tissues constitute organs. 3D-printed networks of picoliter-sized aqueous compartments interconnected by lipid bilayers form a powerful platform for building precisely patterned synthetic tissues. However, this technology has been limited to millimeter-sized networks, with slow fabrication times and lacking flexible design. Here, the authors apply modular design to construct modular synthetic tissues by assembling a wide range of 3D-printed building blocks. They use dedicated modules for storing and releasing reagents, performing logic operations, responding to magnetic fields, and encapsulating living cells. They build centimeter-sized synthetic tissues able to transmit electrical signals through thousands of interconnected compartments. They assemble hybrid tissues composed of both synthetic modules and modules containing living cells. Lastly, by incorporating mutant protein nanopores within the building blocks, they assemble modular synthetic tissues with electrical outputs that are modulated by the integration of chemical inputs.},

  author={Alcinesio, Alessandro and Krishna Kumar, Ravinash and Bayley, Hagan},
  journal={ChemSystemsChem},
  abstract={Vesicles are versatile drug delivery systems and a fundamental chassis from which to build synthetic cells. Multivesicular structures, composed of multiple lipid-bound compartments, could form systems with complex functionalities and recapitulate collective behaviour found in living tissues. However, control over number, composition, and arrangement of compartments within multivesicular structures has been limited. Here, we generate multivesicular structures composed of hundreds of lipid-bound compartments arranged in precisely controlled geometries. Through a dewetting process, we transfer 3D-printed droplet networks from oil to aqueous phase and obtain multivesicular structures with designed, complex architectures stable for weeks. We encapsulate membraneless coacervate sub-compartments within the lipid-bound compartments of the 3D-printed multivesicular structures. Further, we use the multivesicular structures as a platform to build synthetic tissues that interact with the external aqueous environment by releasing or sensing molecules and ions. Finally, we build synthetic tissues that synthesize proteins encoded by encapsulated genes.},

  title={3D printing of microbial communities: A new platform for understanding and engineering microbiomes},
  author={Krishna Kumar, Ravinash and Foster, Kevin R},
  journal={Microbial Biotechnology},
  abstract={3D printing has emerged as a powerful way to produce complex materials on-demand. These printing technologies are now being applied in microbiology, with many recent examples where microbes and matrices are co-printed to create bespoke living materials. Here, we propose a new paradigm for microbial printing. In addition to its importance for materials, we argue that printing can be used to understand and engineer microbiome communities, analogous to its use in human tissue engineering. Many microbes naturally live in diverse, spatially structured communities that are challenging to study and manipulate. 3D printing offers an exciting new solution to these challenges, as it can precisely arrange microbes in 3D space, allowing one to build custom microbial communities for a wide range of purposes in research, medicine, and industry.},
