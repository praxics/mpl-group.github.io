  journal={Chemical Science},
  abstract={A functionalized small-molecule dipeptide capable of structural adaptation is used to prepare coacervate-based protocells that exhibit a pH-triggered process of self-transformation and structural reconfiguration. Polymer-dipeptide coacervate micro-droplets are prepared at pH 8.5 from aqueous mixtures of poly(diallyldimethylammonium chloride) and deprotonated N-(fluorenyl-9-methoxycarbonyl)-D-Ala-D-Ala, and transform into discrete aster-like micro-architectures by controlled lowering of the pH to 4.5. Reconfiguration of the micro-droplets results in entanglement and formation of an interpenetrating fibrous network that subsequently develops into a polymer-containing dipeptide hydrogel. Our results provide a step towards the assembly of synthetic protocells exhibiting rudimentary aspects of metamorphosis, and should offer a new approach to the design and construction of soft reconfigurable chemical micro-ensembles.},

  journal={Small},
   abstract={Acoustic standing waves offer an excellent opportunity to trap and spatially manipulate colloidal objects. This noncontact technique is used for the in situ formation and patterning in aqueous solution of 1D or 2D arrays of pH-responsive coacervate microdroplets comprising poly(diallyldimethylammonium) chloride and the dipeptide N-fluorenyl-9-methoxy-carbonyl-D-alanine-D-alanine. Decreasing the pH of the preformed droplet arrays results in dipeptide nanofilament self-assembly and subsequent formation of a micropatterned supramolecular hydrogel that can be removed as a self-supporting monolith. Guest molecules such as molecular dyes, proteins, and oligonucleotides are sequestered specifically within the coacervate droplets during acoustic processing to produce micropatterned hydrogels containing spatially organized functional components. Using this strategy, the site-specific isolation of multiple enzymes to drive a catalytic cascade within the micropatterned hydrogel films is exploited.},

  abstract={Bacteria often live in diverse communities where the spatial arrangement of strains and species is considered critical for their ecology. However, a test of this hypothesis requires manipulation at the fine scales at which spatial structure naturally occurs. Here we develop a droplet-based printing method to arrange bacterial genotypes across a sub-millimetre array. We print strains of the gut bacterium Escherichia coli that naturally compete with one another using protein toxins. Our experiments reveal that toxin-producing strains largely eliminate susceptible non-producers when genotypes are well-mixed. However, printing strains side-by-side creates an ecological refuge where susceptible strains can persist in large numbers. Moving to competitions between toxin producers reveals that spatial structure can make the difference between one strain winning and mutual destruction. Finally, we print different potential barriers between competing strains to understand how ecological refuges form, which shows that cells closest to a toxin producer mop up the toxin and protect their clonemates. Our work provides a method to generate customised bacterial communities with defined spatial distributions, and reveals that micron-scale changes in these distributions can drive major shifts in ecology.},

  journal={Nature communications},
  abstract={3D-printing networks of droplets connected by interface bilayers are a powerful platform to build synthetic tissues in which functionality relies on precisely ordered structures. However, the structural precision and consistency in assembling these structures is currently limited, which restricts intricate designs and the complexity of functions performed by synthetic tissues. Here, we report that the equilibrium contact angle (θDIB) between a pair of droplets is a key parameter that dictates the tessellation and precise positioning of hundreds of picolitre-sized droplets within 3D-printed, multi-layer networks. When θDIB approximates the geometrically-derived critical angle (θc) of 35.3°, the resulting networks of droplets arrange in regular hexagonal close-packed (hcp) lattices with the least fraction of defects. With this improved control over droplet packing, we can 3D-print functional synthetic tissues with single-droplet-wide conductive pathways. Our new insights into 3D droplet packing permit the fabrication of complex synthetic tissues, where precisely positioned compartments perform coordinated tasks.},

  journal={Advanced Functional Materials},
   abstract={Biology employs modular organization at every scale: molecular building blocks make up living cells, specialized cells organize within tissues, and collections of tissues constitute organs. 3D-printed networks of picoliter-sized aqueous compartments interconnected by lipid bilayers form a powerful platform for building precisely patterned synthetic tissues. However, this technology has been limited to millimeter-sized networks, with slow fabrication times and lacking flexible design. Here, the authors apply modular design to construct modular synthetic tissues by assembling a wide range of 3D-printed building blocks. They use dedicated modules for storing and releasing reagents, performing logic operations, responding to magnetic fields, and encapsulating living cells. They build centimeter-sized synthetic tissues able to transmit electrical signals through thousands of interconnected compartments. They assemble hybrid tissues composed of both synthetic modules and modules containing living cells. Lastly, by incorporating mutant protein nanopores within the building blocks, they assemble modular synthetic tissues with electrical outputs that are modulated by the integration of chemical inputs.},

  abstract={Vesicles are versatile drug delivery systems and a fundamental chassis from which to build synthetic cells. Multivesicular structures, composed of multiple lipid-bound compartments, could form systems with complex functionalities and recapitulate collective behaviour found in living tissues. However, control over number, composition, and arrangement of compartments within multivesicular structures has been limited. Here, we generate multivesicular structures composed of hundreds of lipid-bound compartments arranged in precisely controlled geometries. Through a dewetting process, we transfer 3D-printed droplet networks from oil to aqueous phase and obtain multivesicular structures with designed, complex architectures stable for weeks. We encapsulate membraneless coacervate sub-compartments within the lipid-bound compartments of the 3D-printed multivesicular structures. Further, we use the multivesicular structures as a platform to build synthetic tissues that interact with the external aqueous environment by releasing or sensing molecules and ions. Finally, we build synthetic tissues that synthesize proteins encoded by encapsulated genes.},

  journal={Microbial Biotechnology},
  abstract={3D printing has emerged as a powerful way to produce complex materials on-demand. These printing technologies are now being applied in microbiology, with many recent examples where microbes and matrices are co-printed to create bespoke living materials. Here, we propose a new paradigm for microbial printing. In addition to its importance for materials, we argue that printing can be used to understand and engineer microbiome communities, analogous to its use in human tissue engineering. Many microbes naturally live in diverse, spatially structured communities that are challenging to study and manipulate. 3D printing offers an exciting new solution to these challenges, as it can precisely arrange microbes in 3D space, allowing one to build custom microbial communities for a wide range of purposes in research, medicine, and industry.},
